This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn based on a real-world **Churn Modeling** dataset. Customer churn refers to when a customer stops doing business with a company, and predicting it can help businesses retain valuable clients by taking proactive actions.

The dataset includes features such as customer demographics, account information, and banking activity. Using Python libraries like **TensorFlow/Keras**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**, this project performs the following steps:
Data Preprocessing:
  Cleaning the data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for better model performance.

Model Building:
  A multi-layer feedforward ANN is built using Keras. The model typically includes input, hidden, and output layers with appropriate activation functions like ReLU and Sigmoid.

Training & Evaluation:
  The ANN is trained on a portion of the data, and performance is evaluated on the test set using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.

Prediction:
  The trained model predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their profile and behavior.

This project is a great example of applying deep learning to a practical business problem, helping companies make data-driven decisions for customer retention.
